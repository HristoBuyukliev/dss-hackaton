Japan,J16JP10975-3.1,"1. Personally, I think the quality of the reconstructed images is good (CT images are created by combining slices to reproduce a tissue image of a certain thickness, though whether this accurately reproduces reality is another matter). 2. It is possible to scan quickly over a longer range by moving the patient couch faster during CT scans (increasing the scanning pitch). However, image quality deteriorates. In that sense, the practical image quality of the GE multi-slice CT scanner allows higher-pitch scanning than other brands (such as 1.35 or 1.75). I have heard that in terms of practical image quality, other manufacturer's scanner can only be used at pitches of less than 1 (such as 0.95 or 0.9). 3. At the quotation stage, the maintenance cost was also better than other brands. 4. Since we purchased the equipment we have found that the actual maintenance system is good and we are able to use the equipment with confidence. The minimum slice thickness is 0.625 mm, compared to 0.5 mm for other brands, so that is a disadvantage in terms of resolution."

When it comes to finding out why a failure occurred, the service engineer says there is a black box that is only understood by the head office in Germany, and he does not know. We asked them to replace our system with another one of the same model, and they said they could not do that at the Japanese branch. We have had the equipment freeze while a patient was being examined and on numerous occasions have caused problems for patients, but in the end they would not replace our equipment.
